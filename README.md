# osprey - a stylish fork

![osprey](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JackCDK/osprey/master/128.png)

Get osprey from the chrome store for automatic updates [click me](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/osprey/ekjapccimkannnfgcnnoajhfdglobgak)

## Info

This fork was made because stylish recently got new owners which made it collect, send and sell your data to advertising companies.

I do not plan to make osprey for firefox as it already has [StylRRR](https://addons.mozilla.org/En-us/firefox/addon/stylrrr/)

Please also note that osprey is only available in English, French and German at the moment. I'll add more languages soon.
